# DigitalDeals

## Description

This project is an online storefront for a fake eCommerece business called "DigitalDeals". Users can browse and shop for products on the website. They can also register an account and login. Of course, since this is only a fake store, all of the data is local and not real. That also goes for any external links, like social media accounts.

### Features

- Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover
